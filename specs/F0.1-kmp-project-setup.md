# F0.1: KMP Project Setup

## Objective
Verify and configure the existing KMP project structure for the Reminders app.

## Status
The project was generated from kmp.jetbrains.com wizard. This task verifies everything works.

## Requirements
- [ ] Project builds successfully with `./gradlew build`
- [ ] Android app runs showing "Hello from shared" (or similar)
- [ ] iOS app runs showing same message
- [ ] Package structure is `com.cooleymd.reminders`
- [ ] Gradle version catalog exists at `gradle/libs.versions.toml`

## Verification
```bash
./gradlew build
./gradlew :composeApp:installDebug  # Android
# Open iosApp in Xcode and run on simulator
```

## Files to Verify/Modify
- `settings.gradle.kts` - project name is "Reminders"
- `composeApp/build.gradle.kts` - namespace is correct
- `composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/cooleymd/reminders/` - package exists
- `gradle/libs.versions.toml` - version catalog exists

## Notes
This is mostly verification since the template was already generated. May need minor fixes.
